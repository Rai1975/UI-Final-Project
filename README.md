# Detective David

### Background
As of late, social media is barely human. Captions written by LLMs, pictures generated by AI models and now, even videos! It sucks. 

It may only be an inconvenience for those who are informed, but for many, it is a major source of misinformation.

Detective David is a simple plugin that detects whether a post on a platform is AI-generated or not by using a super futuristic hashing algorithm that can decipher whether a piece of content online is original or not.
